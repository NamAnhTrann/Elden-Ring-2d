DESIGN RATIONALE REQ1

Aspects of the SOLID principles can be seen within the design considerations for REQ1.

Starting with the Birthgiver interface, it is an interface which is meant to be implemented by classes which can give birth to an offspring. This can be seen as an implementation of both the Single-Responsibility principle (as its simple job is to specify if the class can give birth or not), and the Interface Segregation principle. An alternate design consideration could be to make this an abstract class, however in that case the Interface Segregation principle would possibly not have been met. One benefit to the alternative could be the ease of adding the BirthBehaviour within the abstract class itself. However, it is possible that this abstract class approach would cause flexibility issues in the future.

The Egg abstract class extends the Item abstract class. It is meant to be implemented by specific types of eggs. We can possibly see the Single-Responsibility principle, Open/Closed principle (as it simply extends Item and does not necessarily require changes to the item class), the Liskov’s Substitution property. The OmenSheepEgg further extends the Egg abstract class, possibly implementing the Dependency Inversion principle.

Similarly, ConsumeAction and HatchAction classes extend the Action abstract class. It can be seen as implementing the Single-Responsibility principle, and Dependency Inversion Principle.
